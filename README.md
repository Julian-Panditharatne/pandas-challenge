# Pandas Challenge

This challenge involves creating and manipulating DataFrames using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school and standardized test data in csv files called schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv. More specifically, the challenge is

- To merge and aggregate the data from both files to showcase obvious trends in school performance, and then;
- To create a report which includes a written description that cohesively summarizes the analysis and draws at least two observable trends based on the data.

## Repository Files and Folders

Besides this README file, there are four other files and a folder.

The folder, which is called *Resources* contains two csv files:

- **schools_complete.csv**: a dataset containing information about certain schools.

- **students_complete.csv**: a dataset containing information about each of the students of those schools.


The two other files in the repository are the following:

- **PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb**: The jupyter notebook file containing the starter code used in the main script file, **PyCitySchools.ipynb**.

- **PyCitySchools.ipynb**: The jupyter notebook file containing the script run to analyze the school and standardized test data in **schools_complete.csv** and **students_complete.csv**.
