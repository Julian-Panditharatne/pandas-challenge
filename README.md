# Pandas Challenge

This challenge involves creating and manipulating DataFrames using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school and standardized test data in csv files called schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv. More specifically, the challenge is

- To merge and aggregate the data from both files to showcase obvious trends in school performance, and then;
- To create a report which includes a written description that cohesively summarizes the analysis and draws at least two observable trends based on the data.
